# Howdy, I'm Keri West! 👋
#### _Pronouns: he/ him/ his_

I have a strong passion for delving into the world of front-end development, eager to grasp every detail and technique that goes into creating compelling digital experiences. I find immense satisfaction in using my skills to make meaningful and impactful work that resonates with users.

Outside of coding, I love getting my hands dirty with creative projects like home renovations and various DIY endeavors. There's something special about the process of bringing ideas to life through tangible, hands-on work. Combining my technical expertise with a love for hands-on creativity defines my approach to both professional and personal pursuits. It's a journey where innovation meets craftsmanship, and I'm excited to see where it leads next.
